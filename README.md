# Connect-N-game-designe
This is sentiment analysis for the yelp review text and text mining for the review
The game is described: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four.
Now, I alter the code could allow a human player to play a game of ConnectN against two computer players (3 players in total). 
ConnectN is a game identical to Connect4 except that:
• The winning condition is that N counters of the same colour are placed in a line and
• One human player competes against two computer players.
N will be passed to the code as a command line argument and 2 < N < 7.
